/**
 * Everything that differs between the v2 and v3 contract interaction
 * topologies, in one frozen descriptor.
 *
 * The v3 contract (PLAN_CONTRACT_V3_TOPOLOGY.md) replaces every polymorphic
 * identifier field with a mono-typed, `refersTo`-checked one. That splits what
 * used to be a single query surface in two: a like of a post lands in `like`, a
 * like of a reply in `likeReply`; a reply names its thread root and its
 * presentational parent separately; reposts and bookmarks stop accepting reply
 * ids at all. Which surface a lookup uses therefore depends on whether the thing
 * being looked at is a `post` document or a `reply` document — its
 * {@link TargetKind}.
 *
 * On **v2 both kinds resolve to identical surfaces**, which is what lets the
 * kind-aware plumbing issue byte-identical queries to the pre-topology code:
 * {@link groupByInteractionSurface} collapses to a single group, so a mixed
 * feed page still costs exactly one grouped count query per stat.
 *
 * The descriptor is resolved from `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_TOPOLOGY` once, on
 * first use, and deep-frozen: nothing may mutate the shape of the contract the
 * app believes it is talking to part-way through a session.
